<b>	PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</b>
<hr color="purple"/>
<p>A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements in the case of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code output.	</p>
<p>
<hr  color="purple"/>
<b>
LANGUAGE TYPES</b></p>
<hr color="purple"/>
Machine and assembly languages<br>
<ul>
<li> machine language consists of the numeric codes for the operations that a particular computer can execute directly. The codes are strings of 0s and 1s, or binary digits (“bits”), which are frequently converted both from and to hexadecimal (base 16) for human viewing and modification. Machine language instructions typically use some bits to represent operations, such as addition, and some to represent operands, or perhaps the location of the next instruction. Machine language is difficult to read and write, since it does not resemble conventional mathematical notation or human language, and its codes vary from computer to computer.
<li> computer programming, assembly language, often referred to simply as Assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions
</ul>

<b><i>How Many Computer Languages Are There? <br></b></i>
There are about 700 programming languages, including esoteric coding languages. Some sources that only list notable languages still count up to an impressive 245 languages. Another list called HOPL, which claims to include every programming language to ever exist, puts the total number of programming languages at 8,945.

<p><b><i><u><li>PASCAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</li></u></i></b></p>
</ol>
Pascal is a computer programming language developed in the 1970's for the purpose of teaching students to program.<br>  The idea of "structured programming" was also one of the main aims of writing Pascal. <br>Structured programming is the idea that anyone can easily understand a Pascal program because it is split into self contained sections, with each section carrying out one specific task.  As you will see later, a Pascal program can be broken down into self contained sections called procedures and functions.<p>Pascal is a compiled language i.e the English like programming statements which are used in Pascal are converted into a machine code version by a compiler. <br> A computer can only understand machine code instructions, so anything else, such as a programming language must be converted into machine code instructions. <br><ul> <i>There are two ways to do this</i><li> By using an interpreter:  An interpreter takes each program statement during run-time and converts it into machine code.  The machine code instructions are then executed by the computer. <li>By using a compiler</li> A compiler converts a program en mass, at one time, before run-time and creates a machine code version of the program ( referred to as the object code ).  At run-time the object code version of the program is run and the machine code instructions are directly executed.  A compiled program will, because no translation takes place, generally run faster than a interpreted program.
</ul><br>Note: - Pascal programming is implemented / undertaken through an integrated development environment
<p>
APascal program basically consists of the following parts:
<ul>
<li >Program name
<li>Uses command
<li>Type declarations
<li>Constant declarations
<li>Variables declarations
<li>Functions declarations
<li>Procedures declarations
<li> Main program block
<li> Statements and Expressions within each block
<li>Comments
</ul>
Every Pascal program generally have a heading statement, a declaration and an execution 
part strictly in that order. <br>Following format shows the basic syntax for a Pascal program:
<ol><b>program</b> {name of the program}
<br>
<b>uses </b>{comma delimited names of libraries you use}
<br>
<b>const</b> {global constant declaration block}
<br>
<b>var </b>{global variable declaration block}
<br>
<b>function</b> {function declarations, if any}
<br>
{ local variables }
<br>
<b>begin
</b><br>
<b>...</b>
<br>
<b>end;
</b><br>
<b>procedure </b>{ procedure declarations, if any}
<br>
{ local variables }
<br>
<b>begin
</b><br>
<b>...</b>
<br>
<b>end;
</b><br>
<b>begin </b>{ main program block starts}
<br>
<b>...
</b><br>
<b>end.</b> { the end of main program block }
</ol>

2. <b><u><i>C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</i></u></b>
</ol>
The C programming language is a structure oriented programming language, developed at Bell Laboratories in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie. C programming language features were derived from an earlier language called “B” (Basic Combined Programming Language – BCPL). <br>C language was invented for implementing UNIX operating systemIn 1978, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan published the first edition  “The C Programming Language” and commonly known as K&R CIn 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee to provide a modern, comprehensive definition of C. The resulting definition, the ANSI standard, or “ANSI C”, was completed late 1988.
<p>Features of C programming language:<ul><li>Reliability<li>Portability<li>Flexibility<li>Interactivity<li>Modularity<li>Efficiency<li> Effectiveness</ul>
<p>The C programming language is used for developing system applications that forms a major portion of operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux.<br> Below are some examples of where C is being used.<ol>
Database systems<br>Graphics packages<br>Word processors<br>Spreadsheets<br>Operating system development<br>Compilers and Assemblers<br>Network drivers<br>Interpreters
</ol><p><b>C Hello World Example
</b><br>
<i>A C program basically consists of the following parts:
</i>
<ol> Preprocessor Commands
<br>
 Functions<br>
 Variables
<br>
 Statements & Expressions
<br>
 Comments
<br></ol>
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World":
<hr color="yellow"/>
#include <stdio.h>
<br>
int main()
<br>
{
<br>
 /* my first program in C */
<br>
 printf("Hello, World! \n");
<br>
 
 return 0;
<br>
}

<ol>3.<b><i><u>HTML PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</u></i></b></ol>
<i>Hypertext Markup Language </i>consists of tags that are interpreted by the web browser to display text when the HTML file is opened on the screen by Web browser software.
<br> A Tag is a special word enclosed between the less than and greater than (< >) symbols, and the browser can interpret is as a command.E.g., to start a HTML page, type; <HTML> at the top of the document. </br>The Markup tags tell the internet Browser that the file contains HTML-coded information.  They also define the various components of a WWW document such as tables, paragraphs, and lists.
<br> Web pages are written using HTML in a text format that provides many features such as the capability for in-line graphics, font control, and Hypertext links.  <br>A Hypertext link is a word or phrase in an HTML-document that enables the user to jump to another Web page, or connect to another Web Server.
<p> HTML is simple, doesn’t have the declaration part and control structures. <br> In addition, it has many limitations; hence, cannot be used alone when developing functional websites.<p>To add functionality to the HTML pages, some special blocks of code known as scripts are inserted in HTML pages using scripting languages like JavaScript, VBScript and Hypertext Preprocessor. <br>A Script is a small program fragment, written in a different language other than HTML, but inserted into the HTML program.<p> Most HTML tags have an opening tag and a closing tag.<ol><li>  An opening tag is enclosed between< > <li> A closing tag is enclosed between "< /closing>"</ol>The text that is to be displayed on the screen is enclosed between an opening and closing tag.

<ol>4.<b><i><u>JAVASCRIPT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</ol></u></i></b>

<p>
<b>What is JavaScript?</b><br>
<i>Javascript</i>- is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most 
commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side 
script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. <br>It is an interpreted 
programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
<p>JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to 
JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. <br>JavaScript 
made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The 
general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet 
Explorer, and other web browsers.<br>
<p>The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript 
language.<ol>
 JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.<br>
 Designed for creating network-centric applications.<br>
 Complementary to and integrated with Java.<br>
 Complementary to and integrated with HTML.<br>
 Open and cross-platform.</ol>
<p><b><u>Advantages of JavaScript</b></u><br>
The merits of using JavaScript are:<ul>
<li> Less server interaction: You can validate user input before sending the page 
off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your 
server.
<li> Immediate feedback to the visitors: They don't have to wait for a page 
reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
<li>>Increased interactivity: You can create interfaces that react when the user 
hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
<li>Richer interfaces: You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-
drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
</ul>
<b>Limitations of JavaScript</b><br><ul>
<li>We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language.<br><li> It lacks the 
following important features:</ul><ol>
<li>Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has 
been kept for security reason.
<li> JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such 
support available.
<li> JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.</ol>
Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that 
allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages..
