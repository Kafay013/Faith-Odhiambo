DEDICATION

Am personally dedicating this project to all interested programmers including myself.

ABOUT THE PROJECT

Though this is a dummy site of how the real site will look like,,, I have created it with intended intentions of assisting programmers have easy time while doing there research on programming. 
It is a single stop site that contains all programming languages containing detailed information on each including other study materials, videos, links and revision question on each.
The site is still under construction as I intend to continue building it to have more required details and information.

RECOMMENDATIONS

I recommend any interested individual to share a hand in building.
